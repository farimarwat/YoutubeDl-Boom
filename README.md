## Why We Modified It (The Need for youtubedl-boom)  

While **youtubedl-android** is an excellent library (huge thanks to JunkFood for their work ❤️), we found some areas that could be improved to make it more efficient and lightweight. Here’s what led us to create **youtubedl-boom**:  

### 1️⃣ App Size Optimization  
- **Issue:** youtubedl-android packages all necessary files inside the APK, leading to a larger app size.  
- **Solution:** We now **download only the required files** based on the device’s architecture during first-time initialization.  

### 2️⃣ FFmpeg Process Issue (Major Problem 🚨)  
- **Issue:** If a download is started using the FFmpeg downloader and the process is canceled, FFmpeg **keeps running in the background** and continues downloading, causing unnecessary resource consumption.  
- **Solution:** We **properly kill the child process** of FFmpeg when a download is canceled, ensuring no unwanted downloads occur.  

### 3️⃣ Missing Callbacks for FFmpeg Downloads  
- **Issue:** When using FFmpeg for downloading, there was **no callback string/result** to track progress or completion.  
- **Solution:** We now **capture and return output from the FFmpeg process**, giving proper feedback on download status.  

### 4️⃣ Expensive Thread Usage  
- **Issue:** The previous implementation relied on **threads**, which are **resource-heavy** and can lead to performance issues.  
- **Solution:** We replaced **threads with coroutines**, making the code more efficient and responsive.  

### 5️⃣ Unnecessary Code Complexity  
- **Issue:** youtubedl-android used **multiple modules** for simple tasks, making it harder to manage.  
- **Solution:** We **simplified the structure** by consolidating it into **a single module with a single dependency**, making integration much easier.  

With these improvements, **youtubedl-boom** is now more efficient, lightweight, and developer-friendly 🚀.  


## Installation

To use `youtubedl-boom` in your Android project, add the following dependency in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.farimarwat:youtubedl-boom:1.0.2")
}
```

#  📥 YoutubeDl Setup Guide  

## 🔹 Overview  
`YoutubeDlFileManager` handles the downloading of required dependencies like **YouTubeDL, FFmpeg, and Aria2c**. This ensures minimal **APK size** by fetching only necessary files during the first install.  

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Declare a Global Variable  
We create a **nullable** global variable to store the `YoutubeDL` instance.  
This will be initialized **after a successful YouTubeDL setup**.  

```kotlin
var youtubeDl: YoutubeDL? = null
```
- This is usually done in the **App class** or an appropriate singleton.  
- Initially `null`, it will be set when initialization succeeds.  

---

##  ⚡ Step 2: Create the Manager Instance  
Before initializing YouTubeDL, we need a **manager** to handle dependency downloads.  

```kotlin
val manager = YoutubeDlFileManager
    .Builder()
    .withFFMpeg()  // Optional: Needed for merging split video downloads
    .withAria2c()  // Optional: For faster downloads
    .build()
```

- `.withFFMpeg()`: **Required if downloads are split into chunks** (e.g., video & audio separate).  
- `.withAria2c()`: **Optional** but can improve download performance.  
- **Manager ensures necessary files are downloaded on first install.**  

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Initialize YouTubeDL  
Once the manager is set up, we initialize **YouTubeDL**.  

```kotlin
val job = YoutubeDL.getInstance().init(
    appContext = this,  // Application context
    fileManager = manager,           // Required to download missing dependencies
    onSuccess = {
        youtubeDl = it  // Set the global variable
    },
    onError = {
        Timber.e(it)  // Log any errors
    }
)
```

### ✅ Explanation:  
- `fileManager = manager`: **Downloads required files. Downloads are done only one time when app is first executed.**  
- `youtubeDl = it`: Stores the initialized **YouTubeDL instance** for future use.  
- If initialization fails, the error is logged with `Timber.e(it)`.  

---

## 🎯 Summary  
✔️ **Step 1:** Create a global variable for `YoutubeDL`.  
✔️ **Step 2:** Build a **YoutubeDlFileManager** (optional FFmpeg & Aria2c).  
✔️ **Step 3:** Initialize `YoutubeDL` and download required dependencies on first install.  


### 🔹 Example: Retrieving Video Information  

```kotlin
youtubeDl?.getInfo(
    url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
    onSuccess = { videoInfo ->
        println("Title: ${videoInfo.title}")
        println("Duration: ${videoInfo.duration}")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        println("Error: ${error.message}")
    }
)
```

## 📌 Explanation:  
- **`url`** → The YouTube video link.  
- **`onSuccess`** → Callback function that receives `VideoInfo` if retrieval succeeds.  
  - Prints the **title** and **duration** of the video.  
- **`onError`** → Callback function that handles errors if fetching fails.  
  - Prints the error message.  

### ⚙️ How It Works Behind the Scenes:  
- The **video extraction process runs in the background (IO thread)** using **Coroutines**, ensuring the main UI thread remains free.  
- The function spawns a separate process to execute **yt-dlp** with the `--dump-json` option to fetch video details.  
- Standard output (`stdout`) is captured and parsed into a structured `VideoInfo` object.  
- The `onSuccess` or `onError` callback is triggered based on the result.  

This ensures smooth, non-blocking execution while retrieving video metadata.
