## Why We Modified It (The Need for youtubedl-boom)  

While **youtubedl-android** is an excellent library (huge thanks to JunkFood for their work ❤️), we found some areas that could be improved to make it more efficient and lightweight. Here’s what led us to create **youtubedl-boom**:  

### 1️⃣ App Size Optimization  
- **Issue:** youtubedl-android packages all necessary files inside the APK, leading to a larger app size.  
- **Solution:** We now **download only the required files** based on the device’s architecture during first-time initialization.  

### 2️⃣ FFmpeg Process Issue (Major Problem 🚨)  
- **Issue:** If a download is started using the FFmpeg downloader and the process is canceled, FFmpeg **keeps running in the background** and continues downloading, causing unnecessary resource consumption.  
- **Solution:** We **properly kill the child process** of FFmpeg when a download is canceled, ensuring no unwanted downloads occur.  

### 3️⃣ Missing Callbacks for FFmpeg Downloads  
- **Issue:** When using FFmpeg for downloading, there was **no callback string/result** to track progress or completion.  
- **Solution:** We now **capture and return output from the FFmpeg process**, giving proper feedback on download status.  

### 4️⃣ Expensive Thread Usage  
- **Issue:** The previous implementation relied on **threads**, which are **resource-heavy** and can lead to performance issues.  
- **Solution:** We replaced **threads with coroutines**, making the code more efficient and responsive.  

### 5️⃣ Unnecessary Code Complexity  
- **Issue:** youtubedl-android used **multiple modules** for simple tasks, making it harder to manage.  
- **Solution:** We **simplified the structure** by consolidating it into **a single module with a single dependency**, making integration much easier.  

With these improvements, **youtubedl-boom** is now more efficient, lightweight, and developer-friendly 🚀.
